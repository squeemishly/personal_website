      In a recent conversation with my girlfriend, I was trying to explain how I understand the complications of emotions. Natually, because my girlfriend isn't a programmer, I decided to use Ruby and Test Driven Development to express this. I'm great at relationships...

      OK, so here's the deal, emotions are complicated. Sometimes it takes some work to boil down to what's really going on. If I'm upset that you didn't call, is it because I'm worried about you? Or because you really should have fucking called and clearly you don't care about me and everything is broken in the world and I'm dying inside and...
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Deep breaths ...
    </p>
    <p>
      What's happening inside my mind in that moment is almost exactly what my methods look like when I'm just trying to write code instead of using Test Driven Development. My methods become long, convoluted, histrionic messes!

      If I can take a moment to think about my emotions before I act on them, I'm significantly more likely to have a productive conversation about why I'm upset. I.E., Instead of flying off the handle when the negligent caller finally makes contact, I can make an intelligent ask that will actually address the root of my concerns. It turns the conversation from an accusitory "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?" into a much more understandable and relatable, "Hey, can you call me next time. I was worried you might have died."

      Let's actually examine what that would look like in Ruby:
